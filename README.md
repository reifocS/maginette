# MAGINET [WIP]

You want to be able to let your imagination run wild and play any deck you want without paying a fortune?  
Do you want to play with your friends from a distance?  
Maginet is for you!  
Create the deck of your dreams or pick one from your favorite MTG sites, extract it in text format (MTGO), connect by voice with your friend, share your room id and go!  
Be aware that there is no automatic rules. Itâ€™s like to play paper magic, connect in vocal to declare attackers, targets etc. to your opponent, like a physical game.
